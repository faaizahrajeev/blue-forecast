Blue Forecast is a weather app built on HTML/CSS/JS which connects to Open Weather's Current Weather Data API to display the weather details upon typing the city name. Weather details include temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Some cool features include changing weather icons depending on the weather (Cloudy/Misty/Drizzle/Snow/Rain/Sunny) and obv the pretty graphics.

Credits to @GreatStackDev on YouTube for providing the know-how on how to do my first JS project!
